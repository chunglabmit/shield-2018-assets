# shield-2018-assets
Binary assets for shield-2018 docker image

This repository contains binary file assets that are useful when running
the software in the shield-2018 Docker image. They are included here using
GIT LFS so that they can be downloaded by the shield-2018 script to
work-around lack of GIT LFS support in docker hub.

The binary files in the "atlas" directory are derived from files generated
by the Allen Brain Atlas group. If used, they should be cited as
"Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (2018)" (see https://alleninstitute.org/legal/citation-policy/)
